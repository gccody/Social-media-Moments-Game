<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The project will be built using the best security i know to my knowledge. I will take highlights from multiple social media platforms old and new and it will be put into one game where you must collect all of these moments and play minigames with these moments. The game will be fully online to try my absolute best against hacking. If any vulnerabilities are found please contact me or make a pull request with the fix for the game.

This game is fully developed on my free time and doesn't get any funding so please do not harass me if you want to see this game get developed faster i am doing my best.
